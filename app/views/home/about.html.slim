  h1.title.is-1 About
  p
    | Chordly is a free, open-source online chord sheet creator. 
    |  It helps musicians write, organise, and share chord sheets without the hassle of clunky software or scattered notes.
    |  It is a hobby project created by
    a href="https://github.com/stufro" target="_blank" rel="noopener"  Stuart Frost
    |  which was launched in the Autumn of 2022. What began as a small side project quickly grew into a tool that musicians,
    |  teachers, and performers around the world now use to prepare for gigs, lessons, and practice sessions.

  h2.title.is-3 Why open-source?
  p
    | Chordly is open-source because great software becomes even better when a community can shape it. Transparency,
    |  collaboration, and shared learning are at the heart of open-source projects.
    |  If you're curious about why open-source matters, you can
